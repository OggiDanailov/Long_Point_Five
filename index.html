          <p> The Long Point Five is a homegrown ensemble based on the island of Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, Massachusetts. The group is composed of John Schilling on trumpet, Julie Schilling on clarinet, Jim Athearn on trombone, Bud Larson on flute and Jeri Larson on piano. </p>

          <p>LP5 is known for its unique arrangements of eclectic repertory, all written especially for the group by flutist Bud Larson. Works include classical selections by Bach and Debussy, jazz from Dixieland to Mingus, popular standards from Stardust to Gershwin, and Latin and tango numbers. </p>

          <p>LP5 performs year-round on and off the island at public and private venues and is available for parties, fundraisers, and other occasions.

          <p>LPF gradually developed from couple of people sharing similar musical testes and enthusiasm to a fully functional quintet with regular gigs on the island.</p>
          <p> Approximately 4 years ago Bud, Jerri and Jim started playing togehter and soon after that John and Julie joined them. As they were all professionally trianed muisicians, they all clicked easily with and that permitted them to come up with an abundant repertoire in relatively short time. 
            Bud, who is a Yale graduate in composition took the role to do the arrangement of the pieces. He would print out tens of empty scores, would split them in 5 different piles (for each instrument) and gradually transform each piece into 5 insturment song.</p>
           <p> Apart from famous classic jazz tunes from the mid-20 century, LPF also began incorpotating some classical song too - most notabley Bach's pieces and Chopin's famous piano etude n. 3</p>
